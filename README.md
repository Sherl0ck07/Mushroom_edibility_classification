# Mushroom_edibility_classification

**Overview**

This project aims to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features such as cap shape, gill color, stem height, and more, which help in determining the edibility of mushrooms.

**Dataset**\n
The dataset consists of multiple categorical and numerical features describing different properties of mushrooms. Some key attributes include:\n
cap-diameter: Size of the mushroom cap.\n
cap-shape: Shape of the cap.\n
gill-attachment: The way gills are attached to the stem.\n
gill-color: Color of the gills.\n
stem-height: Height of the stem.\n
stem-width: Width of the stem.\n
stem-color: Color of the stem.\n
season: Season in which the mushroom grows.\n
class: Label indicating whether the mushroom is edible (0) or poisonous (1).\n
